Custom hardware tree for the Duet platform (version 1.0.5)


This tree is based upon the official "Arduino Due" 1.6.5 platform files, however the following changes were made:

- WString class is no longer present in the Arduino core. Use char arrays in conjunction with StringRef containers instead
- EMAC RX buffers were increased to 128*32 for optimal network performance
- UART classes were expanded by a "canWrite" method for better sending performance


To include this hardware tree, open the Arduino IDE.  Open the Boards Manager and install the Due device tree.  Then
go to File -> Preferences and set "Additional Boards Manager URLs" to:

  https://github.com/chrishamm/RepRapFirmware/raw/dev/Hardware/package_reprap_index.json

IMPORTANT: As of Arduino 1.6.5, there is a bug that prevents the proper installation of this device tree. However, as a
work-around, you must install the "Arduino SAM boards" package first. Once you have done this, open the "Boards Manager"
again and install the Duet device tree in the same way.

Many thanks to David Crocker aka dc42 for providing the initial Arduino core patches
and to Tony@T3P3 for providing the necessary changes for their new Duet 0.8.5!
