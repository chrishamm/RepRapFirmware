Custom hardware tree for the Duet platform (version 1.1.1)


This device tree is based on the official "Arduino Due" 1.6.5 platform files, however the following changes have been made:

- WString class is no longer present in the Arduino core. Use char arrays in conjunction with StringRef containers instead
- IPAddress and Network classes have been dropped from the Arduino core, because LwIP cannot be wrapped adequately
- EMAC RX buffer has been expanded to 24*128 bytes
- UART classes have been expanded by a "canWrite" method
- TRNG support for random() has been added
- Low-level Arduino libraries from RepRapFirmware have been integrated
- SamNonDuePin library has been merged into the SAM3X variant code
- Implemented USB VBUS detection to check properly if the USB port is open

To include this hardware tree, open the Arduino IDE.  Open the Boards Manager and install the Due device tree.  Then
go to File -> Preferences and set "Additional Boards Manager URLs" to:

  https://github.com/chrishamm/RepRapFirmware/raw/dev/Hardware/package_reprap_index.json

IMPORTANT: As of Arduino 1.6.5, there is a bug that prevents the proper installation of this device tree. However, as a
work-around, you must install the "Arduino SAM boards" package first. Once you have done this, open the "Boards Manager"
again and install the Duet device tree in the same way.

Many thanks to David Crocker aka dc42 for providing the initial Arduino core patches among other improvements and to
Tony Lock for providing the necessary changes for their new Duet 0.8.5!
