This directory contains multiple sys directories for each Ormerod printer configuration.

You MUST copy the "gcodes", "macros", "www" and the right "sys-<machine>" directory to your SD card and rename it to "sys". You can then customise your machine parameters in the config.g file.

Also don't forget to update your /web directory with my latest Ormerod web interface from https://github.com/chrishamm/DuetWebControl (use "Download ZIP" on the right side).
